  "Selective Disclosure for JWTs — [RFC 9901](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9901.html).

   The salted-hash mechanism itself: an Issuer replaces a claim's value with a
   digest, hands the cleartext over separately as a Disclosure, and a Holder
   chooses which Disclosures to forward. A Verifier recomputes the digests and
   puts back only what it was given.

   This is the enterprise privacy primitive — \"prove you are an auditor at Acme
   without revealing your name\" — and it needs no signature to be meaningful,
   which is why it is separable from the JWS that carries it.

   ## The one thing to get right

   §4.2.3: **the digest is computed over the US-ASCII bytes of the
   base64url-encoded Disclosure**, not over the JSON inside it. Two consequences,
   both load-bearing:

     1. Hashing the decoded JSON instead — the intuitive reading — produces
        digests no other implementation can reproduce.
     2. Because the Verifier re-hashes the *string it received*, the Issuer's
        exact JSON serialization never has to be reproduced. **No canonicalization
        is required anywhere in SD-JWT**, unlike Data Integrity. A whitespace
        difference is simply part of the bytes that were hashed.

   ## Reject versus ignore is asymmetric, and deliberately so

   §7.1 requires REJECTING the whole SD-JWT for a duplicate digest, or for a
   Disclosure that was sent but never referenced. But an embedded digest with no
   matching Disclosure MUST be *ignored* — that is the normal case, since it is
   exactly what a claim the Holder chose to withhold looks like. Collapsing those
   two into one behaviour breaks either selective disclosure or the integrity
   check, depending on which way you collapse it.

   ## What this namespace does NOT do

   No JWS. It does not sign, verify, or parse a compact JWS, and it does not check
   `iss`/`exp`/`cnf` or a Key Binding JWT. `conceal`/`disclose` operate on the
   payload as data, which is what makes them testable without a key. A JWS layer
   belongs above this and can use `org-ietf-ed25519` or
   `org-w3-vc-data-integrity`'s P-256 primitives.

   JSON codecs are injected for the same reason `oid4vp.core` injects one: this
   library has no JSON dependency and does not want one.
